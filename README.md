📊 Portfolio Analysis – Python Project

A practical financial analytics project focused on portfolio evaluation, asset return analysis, and risk measurements using Python.


🚀 Project Overview

This project applies essential analytical techniques for investment portfolios, including:

✅ Time series processing
✅ Daily returns calculation
✅ Correlation analysis
✅ Portfolio performance evaluation
✅ Risk metrics
✅ Asset allocation visualization

It is structured into three exercises, each focusing on a key concept in financial data analysis.

📂 Datasets Used

The project uses three CSV files:

File - Description
asset_price_data.csv - Daily prices of financial assets
portfolio_weights.csv - Daily allocation weights for each asset
asset_information_data.csv - Asset categories (family/group)

✅ Exercise 1 — Data Loading & Normalization

Load asset prices

Plot price evolution

Normalize all assets to start at the same value (baseline = 1)

Purpose: Enables comparison across different assets regardless of original price scale.

✅ Exercise 2 — Daily Returns & Correlation Analysis

Compute percentage daily returns

Generate the correlation matrix

Create scatter plots comparing asset behaviors

Purpose: Helps identify relationships, diversification potential, and co-movement between assets.

✅ Exercise 3 — Portfolio Performance Analysis

Load and visualize portfolio weights

Compute cumulative portfolio returns

Calculate annualized return

Calculate annualized volatility (based on 261 trading days)

Visualize allocation by asset family/category

Purpose: Understand portfolio structure, long-term behavior, and risk-adjusted consistency.

📊 Key Visualizations

The notebook includes:

📈 Price time series
📉 Normalized price chart
🔁 Correlation matrix
⚫ Scatter plot between two assets
📘 Portfolio cumulative returns
🟩 Asset weight area plot
🟦 Asset weight distribution grouped by category

These plots help build a comprehensive understanding of portfolio dynamics and asset interactions.

📈 Metrics Calculated
✅ Daily Returns

Percentage change between consecutive days.

✅ Cumulative Returns

Full growth of the portfolio across the entire period.

✅ Annualized Return

Performance normalized to yearly equivalence.

✅ Annualized Volatility

Risk measurement scaled to yearly frequency.
